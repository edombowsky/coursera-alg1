/**
 * Write a program Brute.java that examines 4 points at a time and checks whether
 * they all lie on the same line segment, printing out any such line segments to
 * standard output and drawing them using standard drawing. To check whether the
 * 4 points p, q, r, and s are collinear, check whether the slopes between
 * p and q, between p and r, and between p and s are all equal.
 *
 * The order of growth of the running time of your program should be N^4 in the
 * worst case and it should use space proportional to N.
